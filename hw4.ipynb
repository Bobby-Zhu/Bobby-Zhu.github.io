        "For this assignment, you will be developing an artificial neural network to classify data given in the __[Dry Beans Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset#)__. This data set was obtained as a part of a research study by Selcuk University, Turkey, in which a computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features. More details on the study can be found in the following __[research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169919311573)__. <br>\n",

        "Seven different types of dry beans were used in a study in Selcuk University, Turkey, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the **classification** model, images of 13611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features - 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms - were obtained from the grains.\n",
